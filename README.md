<h1> Research: Increasing TVL on Sovryn </h1>
</div>

# Introduction:

This document is intended to provide ways by which TVL can be increased on Sovryn Trading Platform in near future.


# About TVL(TOTAL VALUE LOCKED)
TVL stands for (Total Value Locked). To put it simply, total value locked represents the number of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol.TVL represents the  total amount of underlying supply that is being secured by a specific application by DeFi completely.

TVL is a metric that is used to measure the overall health of the DEFI and yielding market

"DEFI Pulse" made this metric popular during the 2019 bear market.During this period, there was less than $400M locked, and more than 90% of that was concentrated in a single application — MakerDAO. Today, there is over $10.4B of TVL located within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.

# How to calculate TVL?
TVL(USD) is calculated by taking the balance of each smart contract (excluding instances of double counting) and multiplying them by their price in USD.However, there is some recent controversy if the governance tokens for the DeFi protocol itself should be counted or not.For this paper, we will take $58 million as the reference TVL for Sovryn.

# DEFI product categories

The TVL metric is divided into 5 catgories that form bulk of each DEFI application's.Each category is taken into consideration on how tvl is calculated.

## The 5 categories are:
* <b>Lending:</b>
   * Lending is the most popular use case found in the DeFi ecosystem. This process allows depositors to lend their valuable assets such as ETH, WBTC — to borrowers, who then collateralize the loans with their own locked assets.
   * In Lending th TVL metric is measured by calculating the value of assets deposited into smart contracts by both lenders and borrowers.
 
* <b>Decentralized Exchanges:</b>
    * In DEX's TVL is measured by calculating the value of assets deposited into the exchanges smart-contracts.
* <b>Derivatives:</b>
    * TVL in derivative protocols is measured by the value of assets deposited into the smart contracts, which provide the backing to synthetic assets and financial contracts. In options trading applications, users can deposit USDC to earn interest when traders buy the spreads in order to hold a position open.
* <b>Payments:</b>
   * In payment protocols, TVL is measured by the value of assets deposited into smart contracts that are transferred to the payment protocol’s side-chain or plasma implementation.
* <b>Assets:</b>
  * TVL in assets is measured by the number of coins that are tokenized. These tokenized assets represent a 1:1 redemption of the underlying asset.

# Why Investors Lock their Assets into a protocol ?

You can imagine people finding best saving account in a bank with the highest APY, the APY's that are given are from 0.1% APY to less than 3%.These APY's are very less and now days its even more declining i.e even less APY's on your money from bank. So this makes Investors to go on to a different product that yields more APY.When it comes to DEFI products the returns are insane even upto 100% APY's.These crazy returns encourages the investors to take risk and lock there assets in different DEFI Protocols.

# What will cause TVL to go up on Sovryn?

## <b>Yield Farming:</b>
<p align="center">

</p>

 
  * Broadly, yield farming is any effort to put crypto assets to work and generate the most returns possible on those assets.At the simplest level, a yield farmer might move     assets around within a DEFI protocol, constantly chasing whichever pool is offering the best APY from week to week. This might   mean moving into riskier pools from time to time, but a yield farmer can handle risk.
  
  * In a simple example, a yield farmer might put 100,000 USDT into Sovryn. Stablecoins that are bridged to Sovryn are aggregated and returned as XUSD, enabling Sovryn users to     deposit any compatible stablecoin of their choosing and receive XUSD, which is always convertible 1:1 back to all of the dollar-pegged counterparts.This means one can deposit   USDT (ethereum) -> XUSD, and withdraw XUSD -> BUSD (binance), or any of the aggregated stablecoins.
  
  * Now let's say there is a pool XUSD-BTC where the farmer deposits the crypto assets,now what this pool will do that it will allow farmers to enjoy intensive liqudity providers   rewards. The offers can be like "25K SOV will be available to early LPs until 14th June. On 14th June the rewards will be recalibrated. The XUSD-BTC pool will require equal     deposits to both sides of the pool, so you will need to provide both XUSD and BTC at the same time" or offers like "high percentage yields" it will depend pool to pool.
  
  * On sovryn, liquidity providers (LPs) lock their assets in a pool to provide liquidity in return for LP tokens(a representation and receipt of their share within the pool). Fees are generated for the asset they providing liquidity for. example: a trade of USDT to BTC generates a fee amount in BTC. This fee is distributed between liquidity providers as a reward, in exchange for their service.
  
## <b>Lending:</b>
  * Sovryn allows you to earn a passive income through lending, when you are holding your assets for long-terms this is great way to earn intrests on them.In the lend section of the sovryn trading platform you can lend your assets directly to borrowers and receive intrest for lending.The intrest APR is the percentage that you can expect to gain annually for your assets and it can change according to the demand and supply in the market.The SOVRYN Protocol collects and retains 10% of the interest for the insurance fund, which exists to protect lenders from any potential loan defaults.

# How lending and yield farming will cause to tvl to go up on sovryn?
* Yields on Sovryn could attract users from other DeFi lending applications when the kinked interest rate becomes active and lending yields are driven to triple digits or higher in the underlying token with no risk of Impermanent Loss — an extremely attractive prospect. In other words, when lending and borrowing is high, Sovryn yields can become very high and more users will tend to add their funds to the Sovryn dApp.If Sovryn can provide a way that minimizes the losses and maximizes the yields more users will tend to add their fund to sovryn dapp.Moreover , if the yields on sovryn dApp is more attractive and high when compared to yields provided by other dApp protocols user's are willing to take the risk as the end goal of the investor/trader/user is to generate maximum return on their capital and for this they are willing to take higher risks. 

* This in and of itself is likely to bring more users to Sovryn, and when users deposit more assets to Sovryn to be borrowed, TVL is increased.

* Similarly, as more pools are added to Sovryn, more users with crypto assets may be incentivized to deposit them for additional yield. An increase in TVL and decrease in the relative utilization rates of each Sovryn lending pool leads to a constantly calibrated equilibrium in the lending rate.

* Yield Farmers can derive TVL growth on Sovryn. As borrowing rates are brought back to equilibrium from an increase in TVL, yield farmers will be more likely to farm crypto assets due to the higher yields, thus leading to further increases in TVL. In this way, the prior simple assumption can be applied to Sovryn as well: an increase in TVL on Sovryn is attributable to increased popularity, usability, and liquidity.

## <b>Stablecoins:</b>
* Sovryn has XUSD which act as aggregator for stablecoins allowing a single representation of the US dollar on sovryn.XUSD, in its current form, is a precursor (technical preview) of the Babelfish stablecoin aggregator.It facilitates the conversion of multiple USD-pegged stablecoins with each other at a fixed 1:1 ratio.

* <b><u>The list of convertible stablecoins:</b></u>
  * DAI
  * USDT
  * USDC
  * BUSD

* <b><u>The other stablecoins that can be added to the aggregator are:</b></u>
 
  * <b>Paxos Standard ($PAX)</b> – Backed one-to-one by USD deposits and available through Paxos. PAX is available one-to-one in exchange for USD and redeemable one-to-one for USD. Upon redemption, PAX tokens are immediately removed from the supply; PAX are only in existence when the corresponding dollars are in custody.

  * <b>TrueUSD ($TUSD)</b> – A USD-backed ERC20 stablecoin that is fully collateralized, legally protected, and transparently verified by third-party attestations. TrueUSD uses multiple escrow accounts to reduce counterparty risk and to provide token-holders with legal protections against misappropriation. TrueUSD is the first asset token built on the TrustToken platform.

  * <b>Gemini Dollar ($GUSD)</b> – Created at the time of withdrawal from the Gemini platform. Gemini customers may exchange US dollars for Gemini dollars at a 1:1 exchange rate by initiating a withdrawal of Gemini dollars from their Gemini account to any Ethereum address they specify
 
# How Stablecoins will cause TVL to go up on Sovryn?

* Stablecoins will continue to grow and connecting the cryptocurrency industry and traditional finance to bring a much wider adoption.I will discuss about each stable coin that should be implemented to the aggregator.Right now the Sovryn allowd 4 stablecoins to be aggregated.If Sovryn allows aggregation of more stablecoins not only it will help the sovryn by increasing its TVL but it also allows more adoption of the sovryn platform.

* Lets take an example there is a user holding 100000 USDT the user can easily convert that amount to XUSD with 1:1 ratio , but if the user is having 100000 TUSD the user first needs to convert it to USDT then to XUSD so it will be a hassle for the user and the user might give up on the idea of converting the TUSD to XUSD as the user first needs to convert TUSD to USDT.But if the aggregator allows the direct conversion of TUSD to XUSD then the user will happily do it.

* <b>Why Sovryn should Implement TrueUSD ?</b>

  * TrueUSD aims to balance stability and utility — the main use cases of any stablecoin — with security in the form of regular attestations.
  * As such, the stablecoin’s appeal is geared towards larger investors looking to reduce risk, in addition to smaller private traders.TrustToken describes TUSD as “the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar.”
  * It will also result in increase in TVL as user holding TUSD would be attracted to Sovryn platform and they will get their token converted to XUSD and enjoy the sovryn Platform.

* <b>Why Sovryn should Implement Paxos Standard ?</b>
  * The Paxos Standard is a stablecoin that allows any user to exchange U.S. dollars for the Paxos Standard Tokens. Its main goal is to stabilize the dollar with blockchain technology.
  * The Paxos company has a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services that allows them to offer regulated services within the crypto asset world. The token itself is backed by the USD in accounts that are held by the company at the U.S. depository institutions.
  * It will also result in increase in TVL as user holding Paxos Standard would be attracted to Sovryn platform and they will get their token converted to XUSD and enjoy the sovryn Platform.   

* <b>Why Sovryn should Implement GeminiUSD ?</b>
  * Gemini Dollar is the first U.S Dollar to get backing from U.S regulatory body.It's an ERC-20 Token built on ethereum
  * The Gemini Dollar is designed to provide a transparent regulatory connection between traditional financial systems and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole
  * It will also result in increase in TVL as user holding Gusd would be attracted to Sovryn platform and they will get their token converted to XUSD and enjoy the sovryn Platform.   


## DEXES : 
Decentralized exchange is a marketplace where transaction occurs directly between crypto traders. DEXES are also a factor which can be responsible for TVL.As of date 13-07-2021 Curve DEX has the highest TVL when compared with othe DEXES.

# How Decentralized Exchange Can help in Increasing TVL on Sovryn?
  
  As we know, In DEX's TVL is measured by calculating the value of assets deposited into the exchanges smart-contracts.To increase the TVL on Sovryn more users should be willing to use the Sovryn Trade Platform and deposit there crypto assets into it.For this to happen the Sovryn dApp has to gain popularity and trust of the users.The trust of the users can be earned by helping new users out on how to use the Sovryn Platform , Offering something (like some sov token very less amount would be fine just to get the users started with the exchange as they join the platform and some other measures that can be taken to earn the trust of the user. As the more user will use the dapp the more the dapp will gain popularity and trust in the crypto industry.As a result more users will be willing to deposit there crypto assets which will result in Increase in TVL.


# Future Developments That can be done on Sovryn:

1) Non-COLLATERALIZED Stablecoins:
   * A non collateralized coin is independent of any other coin even if ether or US Dollar collapse a non-collateralized coin will survive them.
   * It can add up siginificant value to the sovryn ecosystem as all types of stablecoins would then be available on Sovryn and then a mechanism can be built on Sovryn to earn with these stablecoins.

2) Synthetic Tokens:
   * A synthetic asset is something that derives its value from something else.Synthetic tokens makes tokenizing and trading anything a reality and if it is implemented on Sovryn then the Sovryn users would be able to trade anything for anything.
   * Example: 
     * Imagine a synthetic asset token that tracks corporate co2 emissions in an industrial zone.When emissions rise, token holders (these may be locals living nearby, city officials, and outside speculators) profit as the companies issue co2 tokens. However, when emissions decrease, the companies profit by retaining tokens, incentivizing them to continually reduce co2 emissions.

# Conclusion:

This document decribes the ways to increase TVL on Sovryn in near future, gives understaning of TVL, how its calculated and different DEFI product categories.I hope my research would help the sovryn ecosystem in some way.
