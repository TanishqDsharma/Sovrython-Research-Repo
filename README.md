# Increasing TVL

#### What is TVL?
TVL stands for (Total Value Locked). To put it simply, total value locked represents the number of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol.TVL represents the  total amount of underlying supply that is being secured by a specific application by DeFi completely.

TVL is a metric that is used to measure the overall health of the DEFI and yielding market

"DEFI Pulse" made this metric popular during the 2019 bear market.During this period, there was less than $400M locked, and more than 90% of that was concentrated in a single application — MakerDAO. Today, there is over $10.4B of TVL located within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.

#### How to calculate TVL?
TVL(USD) is calculated by taking the balance of each smart contract (excluding instances of double counting) and multiplying them by their price in USD.

# DEFI product categories

The TVL metric is divided into 5 catgories that form bulk of each DEFI application's.Each category is taken into consideration on how tvl is calculated.

#### The 5 categories are:
* <b>Lending:</b>
   * Lending is the most popular use case found in the DeFi ecosystem. This process allows depositors to lend their valuable assets such as ETH, WBTC — to borrowers, who then collateralize the loans with their own locked assets.
   * In Lending th TVL metric is measured by calculating the value of assets deposited into smart contracts by both lenders and borrowers.
 
* <b>Decentralized Exchanges:</b>
    * In DEX's TVL is measured by calculating the value of assets deposited into the exchanges smart-contracts.
* <b>Derivatives:</b>
    * TVL in derivative protocols is measured by the value of assets deposited into the smart contracts, which provide the backing to synthetic assets and financial contracts. In options trading applications, users can deposit USDC to earn interest when traders buy the spreads in order to hold a position open.
* <b>Payments:</b>
   * In payment protocols, TVL is measured by the value of assets deposited into smart contracts that are transferred to the payment protocol’s side-chain or plasma implementation.
* <b>Assets:</b>
  * TVL in assets is measured by the number of coins that are tokenized. These tokenized assets represent a 1:1 redemption of the underlying asset.

# Why Investors Lock their Assets into a protocol ?

You can imagine people finding best saving account in a bank with the highest APY, the APY's that are given are from 0.1 % APY to less than 3 %.These APY's are very less and now days its even more declining i.e even less APY's on your money from bank. So this makes Investors to go on to a different product that yields more APY.When it comes to DEFI products the returns are insane even upto 100% APY's.These crazy returns encourages the investors to take risk and lock there assets in different DEFI Protocols.
