# Increasing TVL

#### What is TVL?
TVL stands for (Total Value Locked). To put it simply, total value locked represents the number of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol.TVL represents the  total amount of underlying supply that is being secured by a specific application by DeFi completely.

TVL is a metric that is used to measure the overall health of the DEFI and yielding market

"DEFI Pulse" made this metric popular during the 2019 bear market.During this period, there was less than $400M locked, and more than 90% of that was concentrated in a single application — MakerDAO. Today, there is over $10.4B of TVL located within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.

#### How to calculate TVL?
TVL(USD) is calculated by taking the balance of each smart contract (excluding instances of double counting) and multiplying them by their price in USD.

# DEFI product categories

The TVL metric is divided into 5 catgories that form bulk of each DEFI application's.Each category is taken into consideration on how tvl is calculated.

#### The 5 categories are:
* Lending
*   Lending is the most popular use case found in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. This process allows depositors to lend their valuable assets — such as ETH, WBTC, or LINK — to borrowers, who then collateralize the loans with their own locked assets.
In lending, the TVL metric is measured by the value of assets deposited into smart contracts by both the lenders and borrowers. Borrowers are then given a “credit line” containing up to 60% of their locked value.
MakerDAO is the leader in this category, presiding over $1.8B in locked assets that account for 2.39% of the total ETH in circulation and 14% of the total minted WBTC. Borrowers first deposit these assets in order to borrow the DAI stablecoin from the protocol.
* Decentralized Exchanges
* Derivatives
* payments
* Assets
